# prm
A minimal project manager for the terminal.

![Demo](https://github.com/eivind88/prm/blob/demo/prm.gif)

This script **must** be sourced, *not* run in a subshell.
See [usage](#usage) for more information.

At present, prm is mostly developed and tested with `bash`, as this is what I personally use and have the most experience with.
I'm very much open to contributions that fix issues with `zsh` (provided that they don't break `bash` support), and I try to test prm using it every once in a while to the best of my abilities.
As far as I know, prm currently works with `zsh`.

Regrettably, `fish` is not supported because of syntax incompatibilities.
See [this issue](https://github.com/eivind88/prm/issues/2) for some details.
However, Fred Deschenes has made a [port](https://github.com/FredDeschenes/prm-fish) for `fish` that you could check out.

## What?
This program basically lets you CRUD projects. Upon activation, each projects runs its associated start-script; on deactivation, it runs the project stop-script.

These bash-scripts can be used for things like changing directories, setting environment variables, cleanup, etc.

There is basic prompt integration in the form of `[PROJECT] <prompt>`, which can be seen in the animated .gif demo above.

You can have several projects active at once in different shells, as prm associates active instances with the shell PID.
Currently active projects can be listed (as described in [usage](#usage)).

Dead project instances (i.e. project instances that are still active on shell exit) will be automatically deactivated the next time you run prm â€“ without running their stop-scripts.

## How?
Adding and editing projects will open the associated start- and stop-scripts in your editor (as defined by the `$EDITOR` environment variable).

A project start-script might for instance look something like this:

```bash
# cd to project directory
cd $HOME/src/Python/hello-world

# activate conda env
source activate hello-world

# show current git status
git status
```

The same project's stop-script might look like this:

```bash
# deactivate conda env
source deactivate hello-world

# clean up
rm *.log *.tmp
```

When you activate a new project, prm automatically stops any active project in the current shell.

When a project is deactivated, prm changes the working directory back to the path you were originally on before starting your first project.

## Why?
I found myself missing project management features (like those seen in text editors and IDEs) on the terminal.

Instead of remembering what projects I am working on these days or switching between loads of terminal windows or tabs, I now use prm.

## Usage
In order to work properly, prm **must** be sourced, *not* run in a subshell; i.e. `. ./prm`.

The easiest way to do this is probably to add an alias to prm in your `~/.bashrc` (or wherever you keep your aliases), like so:

```bash
alias prm=". path/to/prm.sh"
```

From the help option screen:

```bash
Usage: prm [options] ...
Options:
  active                   List active project instances.
  add <project name>       Add project.
  edit <project name>      Edit project.
  list                     List all projects.
  remove <project name>    Remove project.
  rename <old> <new>       Rename project.
  start <project name>     Start project.
  stop                     Stop active project.
  -h --help                Display this information.
  -v --version             Display version info.
```

You can set the prm data directory with the $PRM_PATH env variable.
By default all prm data is written to `~/.prm`.

## Contributing
Feedback is strongly encouraged. If you run into a bug or would like to see a new feature, please open a new issue. Contributions in the form of code (e.g. implementing new features, bug-fixes) are also appreciated. These should follow the"fork-and-pull" workflow:

1. Fork the repo on Github
2. Create a branch
3. Make and commit your changes
4. Sync (fetch and merge) with "upstream"
5. Push your changes to your branch on Github
6. Open a pull request "upstream" with your changes

Pull requests should explain clearly what changes have been made, and why they have been made. They should also reference any relevant issues.
